    "    \n",
    "    A built-in function is a function that is included in Python by default. These functions\n",
    "    are always available and can be used without the need for any import statements. \n",
    "    Examples of built-in functions in Python include print(), len(), and input().\n",
    "\n",
    "    A user-defined function is a function that is created by the user. These functions are\n",
    "    defined using the def keyword and can be called by name later in the program. Here’s an \n",
    "    example of a user-defined function:\n",
    "        \n",
    "def add_numbers(x, y):\n",
    "    return x + y\n",
    "\n",
    "result = add_numbers(5, 3)\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    " \n",
    "    In this example, we define a function called add_numbers() that takes two arguments (x and y)\n",
    "    and returns their sum. We then call this function with the arguments 5 and 3, which returns 8.\n",
    "    We store this result in a variable called result and print it to the console."

    "2. How can you pass arguments to a function in Python? Explain the difference between positional\n",

    "    \n",
    "    We can pass arguments to a function in Python by including them in the parentheses after \n",
    "    the function name. There are two types of arguments you can pass to a function: \n",
    "    positional arguments and keyword arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Positional arguments are passed to a function in the order that they are defined in the \n",
